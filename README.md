# Adafruit 9DOF Library ![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_9DoF/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)

This driver is for the Adafruit 9DOF Breakout (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1714), and makes use of Adafruit's Unified Sensor Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor) to provide standard SI units of measure and easy to reuse sensor data.

For information about this breakout and how to use this library, consult our online learning guide at http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-9-dof-imu-breakout

## About the 9DOF Breakout ##

Adafruit's 9DOF Breakout includes everything you need for accurate, meaningful motion capture and detection, including the following sensors:

- L3GD20 3-axis gyroscope: ±250, ±500, or ±2000 degree-per-second scale
- LSM303 3-axis compass: ±1.3 to ±8.1 gauss magnetic field scale
- LSM303 3-axis accelerometer: ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g selectable scale

## About this Library ##

The Adafruit_9DOF library makes use of Adafruit's existing libraries for the L3GD20 and LSM303DLHC, but also adds a few helper functions to generate values that are more useful for drones, motion detection, etc.

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code.  Please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!
